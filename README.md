# Tenzi_Game
By Noah Kruse

Program Overview:

This program is a minigame type of program that I made in my Object Oriented Programming class. This program allows the user to play a game that is based on a dice roll. There are ten dice in the game and each one is rolled. The goal of the game is to get all of the dice the same number. The user can choose which dice that they want to reroll after each roll and they can keep the ones with the number that they are aiming for on each die. The goal of this game is to get the fastest time that you can to get 10 dice the same value. To keep track of these scores there is a leaderboard implemented in this program that records all of the top times that have been acheived. Since this program was made in an object oriented course, there are several different classes that are used. There are die objects being created to represent each rolled die and this class handles all of the rerolling as well as the die output. The leaderboard is another class that is keeping track of all of the times for each game is played. Finally, there is a game class that encompasses the general game so that it can be ran multiple times meanwhile keeping track of all attempts. 

Program Instructions:

1. The program starts out by printing out the original 10 die
2. The program asks what die need to be rerolled
3. The user inputs the numbers of die in the form- 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
4. This process is repeated until all of the die show the same value
5. The program states game over and prints out the time, the turns it took the user, and the current leaderboard
6. The program asks the user if they would like to play again
7. If the user selects yes the program goes through this process again, but the next time the previous score will appear on the leaderboard as well
8. If the user selects no the program ends

Program Conclusions:
This program was one of my favorites to implement in my object oriented design class because I felt like it was very eye opening to how a lot of simple games are designed. I enjoy making programs like this that are fun as well as develop my skills very well. A few things that I would change if I were to make this program again would be to find a better way to represent the die that are being rolled. It would be cool to implement a few visuals into this game rather than just text, however this was fairly early in my programming career. Another aspect that I would change would be how the user selects the die to be rerolled. I feel like this part of the program is the worst set up and it is very difficult to enter the die in fast which is the entire point of the game. The input also need to be in the correct form otherwise the program will not work and this becomes a major issue.
